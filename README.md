Initially you can see first 12 pekemons;

You can click on one of the cards and see extended information about particular pekemon;

If you want to get more pekemons you should click on wide button right under the shown list of the pekemons,
then next 12 pekemons will be loaded;

Also you can filter loaded pekemons by they types using selector located right under top left corner of the pekemon list;
